# Midterm Project - Credit Risk Model 

## Description

This project uses a decision tree model for determining whether or not an applicant should be approved for a recreational vehicle loan. 


## Limitations
While random forest and xgboost will improve the accuracy, the idea was to get the highest accuracy possible with a decision tree as it is easily auditable for financial institutions. With access to credit report data the model's accuracy should greatly improve. This is a planned implementation for the future.
